Programming Language - Python

Problem-1
# Define a Calculator class
# Constructor initializes values a, b, and the chosen operation
# Convert the operation to lowercase for consistency
# Method to perform calculation based on operation
# Check for addition
# Check for subtraction
# Check for multiplication
# Check for division
# Prevent division by zero
# Handle invalid operations
# Take first number as input
# Take second number as input
# Take operation name as input
# Create an object of Calculator class
# Call the calculate method
# Print the result


Problem-2
# Take an integer input from the user
# Loop from 0 up to (a - 1)
# Print the odd number generated by the formula 2*i + 1


Problem-3
# Take integer input from the user
# Check if 'a' is even; if yes, subtract 1 to make it odd
# If 'a' is already odd, keep it as is
# Print the first 'n' odd numbers
# Loop through odd numbers from 1 to (2*n - 1)
# Print each odd number on the same line

Problem-4
# Take input from the user as a comma-separated string
# Convert the input string into a list of integers by splitting at commas
# Create an empty dictionary to store the final results
# Loop through numbers 1 to 9 to check divisibility
# Initialize counter for how many numbers are divisible by i
# Check each number in the list
# If the number is divisible by i, increase the count
# Store the count in the dictionary with i as the key
# Print the dictionary containing divisibility counts
